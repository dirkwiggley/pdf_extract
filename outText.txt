'Making Races Game Masters and players who want to make their own races (or cultural archetypes) can usethe system below. Our races are designed with the following rules:\u2022 Races and cultures begin with 2 points of Positive Racial Abilities. Additional positiveEGAVAS abilities must be countered with an equal value of negative ones. A +2 ability, for example,may be countered by a single -2 ability or two -1 abilities.\u2022 If you want to include an ability we haven't included here, simply assign it a value basedon the examples below.Names: Don't be afraid to rename abilities to give your setting more flavor. If you want yourhorse nomads to have Riding skill at d6, for example, you might call it Born in the Saddle. It'sall about creating rich flavor rather than lists of abilities your players have to keep up with.POSitiVe raCiaL aBiLitieSThe number in parentheses after the name of each entry is the number of times the particular enhancementmay be taken. "U" means unlimited.VALUE ABILITYAdaptable (1): The race has great variation among its people and cultures. Characters start2with a free Novice Edge of their choice (and must meet all the Edge's Requirements).Additional Action (1): The being has additional appendages, enhanced reflexes, or exceptional3eye-hand coordination. He may ignore 2 points of Multi-Action penalties each turn.Aquatic/Semi-Aquatic (1): For one point the character is semi-aquatic and can hold his breath1/2 for 15 minutes before checking for drowning. For two, he's native to the water. He cannot drownin oxygenated liquid and moves his full Pace when swimming (see Movement, page 92).Armor (3): The species has a thick hide or is encrusted in solid material like scaly plating or1even rock. This grants Armor +2 each time it's taken.Attribute Increase (U): During character creation, the species increases a particular attribute2 (Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, or Vigor) one die type. This increases the Trait's maximumby one as well.Bite (1): The race has fangs that cause Strength+d4 damage. See Natural Weapons, page1104 for more information.Burrowing (1): The species can burrow into loose earth and move through it at half normalPace (he cannot run). He cannot normally be attacked while burrowing, and can attempt to1 surprise opponents who didn't see him coming by making an opposed Stealth vs. Noticeroll. If successful, the burrower adds +2 to his attack and damage rolls that round, or +4 witha raise (he has The Drop, page 100).Claws (1): The race has claws that cause Str+d4 damage. One more point may be spent to2/3/4 increase their damage to Strength+d6, and/or another to add AP 2. See Natural Weapons,page 104 for more information.Construct (1): Constructs are artificial beings made of inorganic material. They add +2 torecover from being Shaken, ignore one level of Wound modifiers, don't breathe, and are8 immune to disease and poison. Wounds must be mended via the Repair skill. Each attempttakes one hour per current Wound level and ignores the "Golden Hour". Many Constructshave the Dependency Negative Racial Ability (reflecting their need for a power source).Doesn't Breathe (1): The species does not breathe. Individuals aren't affected by inhaled2toxins, can't drown, and don't suffocate in a vacuum. (They may still freeze, however.)Edge (U): All members of this race have the same innate Edge chosen from those available2+X in the setting. Unlike Adaptable, this ability ignores Requirements except other Edges. EachRank beyond Novice costs an additional point to a maximum of Heroic Rank (5).Environmental Resistance (U): The species receives a +4 bonus to resist a single negative1 environmental effect, such as heat, cold, lack of air, radiation, etc. Damage from that sourceis also reduced by 4.18'
